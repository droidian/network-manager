Run NetworkManager in Container for Development
===============================================

Run `nm-in-container` script for running NetworkManager in a non-root,
privileged  podman container. Run `nm-in-vm` to do it in a vitual machine.
This is useful for testing NetworkManager for development.

Try `./nm-in-container --help` or `./nm-in-vm --help` to see options.  Inside
the container, see the bash history for useful commands and read the hints in
"/etc/motd".
