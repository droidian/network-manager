.SH "NAME"
nm-settings-nmcli \- Description of settings and properties of NetworkManager connection profiles for nmcli
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
NetworkManager is based on a concept of connection profiles, sometimes referred to as connections only\&. These connection profiles contain a network configuration\&. When NetworkManager activates a connection profile on a network device the configuration will be applied and an active network connection will be established\&. Users are free to create as many connection profiles as they see fit\&. Thus they are flexible in having various network configurations for different networking needs\&.
.PP
NetworkManager provides an API for configuring connection profiles, for activating them to configure the network, and inspecting the current network configuration\&. The command line tool
\fInmcli\fR
is a client application to NetworkManager that uses this API\&. See
\fBnmcli\fR(1)
for details\&.
.PP
With commands like
nmcli connection add,
nmcli connection modify
and
nmcli connection show, connection profiles can be created, modified and inspected\&. A profile consists of properties\&. On D\-Bus this follows the format as described by
\fBnm-settings-dbus\fR(5), while this manual page describes the settings format how they are expected by
\fInmcli\fR\&.
.PP
The settings and properties shown in tables below list all available connection configuration options\&. However, note that not all settings are applicable to all connection types\&.
\fInmcli\fR
connection editor has also a built\-in
\fIdescribe\fR
command that can display description of particular settings and properties of this page\&.
.PP
The
\fIsetting\fR
and
\fIproperty\fR
can be abbreviated provided they are unique\&. The list below also shows aliases that can be used unqualified instead of the full name\&. For example
connection\&.interface\-name
and
ifname
refer to the same property\&.
.SS "connection setting"
.PP
General Connection Profile Settings\&.
.PP
Properties:
.PP
\fBconnection\&.auth\-retries\fR
.RS 4
The number of retries for the authentication\&. Zero means to try indefinitely; \-1 means to use a global default\&. If the global default is not set, the authentication retries for 3 times before failing the connection\&.
.sp
Currently, this only applies to 802\-1x authentication\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.autoconnect\fR
.RS 4
Alias: autoconnect
.sp
Whether or not the connection should be automatically connected by NetworkManager when the resources for the connection are available\&. TRUE to automatically activate the connection, FALSE to require manual intervention to activate the connection\&.
.sp
Autoconnect happens when the circumstances are suitable\&. That means for example that the device is currently managed and not active\&. Autoconnect thus never replaces or competes with an already active profile\&.
.sp
Note that autoconnect is not implemented for VPN profiles\&. See "secondaries" as an alternative to automatically connect VPN profiles\&.
.sp
If multiple profiles are ready to autoconnect on the same device, the one with the better "connection\&.autoconnect\-priority" is chosen\&. If the priorities are equal, then the most recently connected profile is activated\&. If the profiles were not connected earlier or their "connection\&.timestamp" is identical, the choice is undefined\&.
.sp
Depending on "connection\&.multi\-connect", a profile can (auto)connect only once at a time or multiple times\&.
.sp
Format: boolean
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.autoconnect\-priority\fR
.RS 4
The autoconnect priority in range \-999 to 999\&. If the connection is set to autoconnect, connections with higher priority will be preferred\&. The higher number means higher priority\&. Defaults to 0\&. Note that this property only matters if there are more than one candidate profile to select for autoconnect\&. In case of equal priority, the profile used most recently is chosen\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.autoconnect\-retries\fR
.RS 4
The number of times a connection should be tried when autoactivating before giving up\&. Zero means forever, \-1 means the global default (4 times if not overridden)\&. Setting this to 1 means to try activation only once before blocking autoconnect\&. Note that after a timeout, NetworkManager will try to autoconnect again\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.autoconnect\-slaves\fR
.RS 4
Whether or not slaves of this connection should be automatically brought up when NetworkManager activates this connection\&. This only has a real effect for master connections\&. The properties "autoconnect", "autoconnect\-priority" and "autoconnect\-retries" are unrelated to this setting\&. The permitted values are: 0: leave slave connections untouched, 1: activate all the slave connections with this connection, \-1: default\&. If \-1 (default) is set, global connection\&.autoconnect\-slaves is read to determine the real value\&. If it is default as well, this fallbacks to 0\&.
.sp
Format: NMSettingConnectionAutoconnectSlaves (int32)
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.dns\-over\-tls\fR
.RS 4
Whether DNSOverTls (dns\-over\-tls) is enabled for the connection\&. DNSOverTls is a technology which uses TLS to encrypt dns traffic\&.
.sp
The permitted values are: "yes" (2) use DNSOverTls and disabled fallback, "opportunistic" (1) use DNSOverTls but allow fallback to unencrypted resolution, "no" (0) don\*(Aqt ever use DNSOverTls\&. If unspecified "default" depends on the plugin used\&. Systemd\-resolved uses global setting\&.
.sp
This feature requires a plugin which supports DNSOverTls\&. Otherwise, the setting has no effect\&. One such plugin is dns\-systemd\-resolved\&.
.sp

.PP
\fBconnection\&.gateway\-ping\-timeout\fR
.RS 4
If greater than zero, delay success of IP addressing until either the timeout is reached, or an IP gateway replies to a ping\&.
.sp
Format: uint32
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.id\fR
.RS 4
Alias: con\-name
.sp
A human readable unique identifier for the connection, like "Work Wi\-Fi" or "T\-Mobile 3G"\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.interface\-name\fR
.RS 4
Alias: ifname
.sp
The name of the network interface this connection is bound to\&. If not set, then the connection can be attached to any interface of the appropriate type (subject to restrictions imposed by other settings)\&.
.sp
For software devices this specifies the name of the created device\&.
.sp
For connection types where interface names cannot easily be made persistent (e\&.g\&. mobile broadband or USB Ethernet), this property should not be used\&. Setting this property restricts the interfaces a connection can be used with, and if interface names change or are reordered the connection may be applied to the wrong interface\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.lldp\fR
.RS 4
Whether LLDP is enabled for the connection\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.llmnr\fR
.RS 4
Whether Link\-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) is enabled for the connection\&. LLMNR is a protocol based on the Domain Name System (DNS) packet format that allows both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts to perform name resolution for hosts on the same local link\&.
.sp
The permitted values are: "yes" (2) register hostname and resolving for the connection, "no" (0) disable LLMNR for the interface, "resolve" (1) do not register hostname but allow resolving of LLMNR host names If unspecified, "default" ultimately depends on the DNS plugin (which for systemd\-resolved currently means "yes")\&.
.sp
This feature requires a plugin which supports LLMNR\&. Otherwise, the setting has no effect\&. One such plugin is dns\-systemd\-resolved\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.master\fR
.RS 4
Alias: master
.sp
Interface name of the master device or UUID of the master connection\&.
.sp

.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.mdns\fR
.RS 4
Whether mDNS is enabled for the connection\&.
.sp
The permitted values are: "yes" (2) register hostname and resolving for the connection, "no" (0) disable mDNS for the interface, "resolve" (1) do not register hostname but allow resolving of mDNS host names and "default" (\-1) to allow lookup of a global default in NetworkManager\&.conf\&. If unspecified, "default" ultimately depends on the DNS plugin (which for systemd\-resolved currently means "no")\&.
.sp
This feature requires a plugin which supports mDNS\&. Otherwise, the setting has no effect\&. One such plugin is dns\-systemd\-resolved\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.metered\fR
.RS 4
Whether the connection is metered\&.
.sp
When updating this property on a currently activated connection, the change takes effect immediately\&.
.sp
Format: NMMetered (int32)
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.mptcp\-flags\fR
.RS 4
Whether to configure MPTCP endpoints and the address flags\&. If MPTCP is enabled in NetworkManager, it will configure the addresses of the interface as MPTCP endpoints\&. Note that IPv4 loopback addresses (127\&.0\&.0\&.0/8), IPv4 link local addresses (169\&.254\&.0\&.0/16), the IPv6 loopback address (::1), IPv6 link local addresses (fe80::/10), IPv6 unique local addresses (ULA, fc00::/7) and IPv6 privacy extension addresses (rfc3041, ipv6\&.ip6\-privacy) will be excluded from being configured as endpoints\&.
.sp
If "disabled" (0x1), MPTCP handling for the interface is disabled and no endpoints are registered\&.
.sp
The "enabled" (0x2) flag means that MPTCP handling is enabled\&. This flag can also be implied from the presence of other flags\&.
.sp
Even when enabled, MPTCP handling will by default still be disabled unless "/proc/sys/net/mptcp/enabled" sysctl is on\&. NetworkManager does not change the sysctl and this is up to the administrator or distribution\&. To configure endpoints even if the sysctl is disabled, "also\-without\-sysctl" (0x4) flag can be used\&. In that case, NetworkManager doesn\*(Aqt look at the sysctl and configures endpoints regardless\&.
.sp
Even when enabled, NetworkManager will only configure MPTCP endpoints for a certain address family, if there is a unicast default route (0\&.0\&.0\&.0/0 or ::/0) in the main routing table\&. The flag "also\-without\-default\-route" (0x8) can override that\&.
.sp
When MPTCP handling is enabled then endpoints are configured with the specified address flags "signal" (0x10), "subflow" (0x20), "backup" (0x40), "fullmesh" (0x80)\&. See ip\-mptcp(8) manual for additional information about the flags\&.
.sp
If the flags are zero (0x0), the global connection default from NetworkManager\&.conf is honored\&. If still unspecified, the fallback is "enabled,subflow"\&. Note that this means that MPTCP is by default done depending on the "/proc/sys/net/mptcp/enabled" sysctl\&.
.sp
NetworkManager does not change the MPTCP limits nor enable MPTCP via "/proc/sys/net/mptcp/enabled"\&. That is a host configuration which the admin can change via sysctl and ip\-mptcp\&.
.sp
Strict reverse path filtering (rp_filter) breaks many MPTCP use cases, so when MPTCP handling for IPv4 addresses on the interface is enabled, NetworkManager would loosen the strict reverse path filtering (1) to the loose setting (2)\&.
.sp
Format: uint32
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.mud\-url\fR
.RS 4
If configured, set to a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) URL that points to manufacturer\-recommended network policies for IoT devices\&. It is transmitted as a DHCPv4 or DHCPv6 option\&. The value must be a valid URL starting with "https://"\&.
.sp
The special value "none" is allowed to indicate that no MUD URL is used\&.
.sp
If the per\-profile value is unspecified (the default), a global connection default gets consulted\&. If still unspecified, the ultimate default is "none"\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.multi\-connect\fR
.RS 4
Specifies whether the profile can be active multiple times at a particular moment\&. The value is of type NMConnectionMultiConnect\&.
.sp

.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.permissions\fR
.RS 4
An array of strings defining what access a given user has to this connection\&. If this is NULL or empty, all users are allowed to access this connection; otherwise users are allowed if and only if they are in this list\&. When this is not empty, the connection can be active only when one of the specified users is logged into an active session\&. Each entry is of the form "[type]:[id]:[reserved]"; for example, "user:dcbw:blah"\&.
.sp
At this time only the "user" [type] is allowed\&. Any other values are ignored and reserved for future use\&. [id] is the username that this permission refers to, which may not contain the ":" character\&. Any [reserved] information present must be ignored and is reserved for future use\&. All of [type], [id], and [reserved] must be valid UTF\-8\&.
.sp
Format: array of string

.sp
Format: array of string
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.slave\-type\fR
.RS 4
Alias: slave\-type
.sp
Setting name of the device type of this slave\*(Aqs master connection (eg, "bond"), or NULL if this connection is not a slave\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.stable\-id\fR
.RS 4
This represents the identity of the connection used for various purposes\&. It allows to configure multiple profiles to share the identity\&. Also, the stable\-id can contain placeholders that are substituted dynamically and deterministically depending on the context\&.
.sp
The stable\-id is used for generating IPv6 stable private addresses with ipv6\&.addr\-gen\-mode=stable\-privacy\&. It is also used to seed the generated cloned MAC address for ethernet\&.cloned\-mac\-address=stable and wifi\&.cloned\-mac\-address=stable\&. It is also used to derive the DHCP client identifier with ipv4\&.dhcp\-client\-id=stable, the DHCPv6 DUID with ipv6\&.dhcp\-duid=stable\-[llt,ll,uuid] and the DHCP IAID with ipv4\&.iaid=stable and ipv6\&.iaid=stable\&.
.sp
Note that depending on the context where it is used, other parameters are also seeded into the generation algorithm\&. For example, a per\-host key is commonly also included, so that different systems end up generating different IDs\&. Or with ipv6\&.addr\-gen\-mode=stable\-privacy, also the device\*(Aqs name is included, so that different interfaces yield different addresses\&. The per\-host key is the identity of your machine and stored in /var/lib/NetworkManager/secret_key\&. See NetworkManager(8) manual about the secret\-key and the host identity\&.
.sp
The \*(Aq$\*(Aq character is treated special to perform dynamic substitutions at activation time\&. Currently, supported are "${CONNECTION}", "${DEVICE}", "${MAC}", "${BOOT}", "${RANDOM}"\&. These effectively create unique IDs per\-connection, per\-device, per\-boot, or every time\&. The "${CONNECTION}" uses the profile\*(Aqs connection\&.uuid, the "${DEVICE}" uses the interface name of the device and "${MAC}" the permanent MAC address of the device\&. Any unrecognized patterns following \*(Aq$\*(Aq are treated verbatim, however are reserved for future use\&. You are thus advised to avoid \*(Aq$\*(Aq or escape it as "$$"\&. For example, set it to "${CONNECTION}\-${BOOT}\-${DEVICE}" to create a unique id for this connection that changes with every reboot and differs depending on the interface where the profile activates\&.
.sp
If the value is unset, a global connection default is consulted\&. If the value is still unset, the default is "default${CONNECTION}" go generate an ID unique per connection profile\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.timestamp\fR
.RS 4
The time, in seconds since the Unix Epoch, that the connection was last _successfully_ fully activated\&.
.sp
NetworkManager updates the connection timestamp periodically when the connection is active to ensure that an active connection has the latest timestamp\&. The property is only meant for reading (changes to this property will not be preserved)\&.
.sp
Format: uint64
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.type\fR
.RS 4
Alias: type
.sp
Base type of the connection\&. For hardware\-dependent connections, should contain the setting name of the hardware\-type specific setting (ie, "802\-3\-ethernet" or "802\-11\-wireless" or "bluetooth", etc), and for non\-hardware dependent connections like VPN or otherwise, should contain the setting name of that setting type (ie, "vpn" or "bridge", etc)\&.
.sp
Format: string
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.uuid\fR
.RS 4
The connection\&.uuid is the real identifier of a profile\&. It cannot change and it must be unique\&. It is therefore often best to refer to a profile by UUID, for example with `nmcli connection up uuid $UUID`\&.
.sp
The UUID cannot be changed, except in offline mode\&. In that case, the special values "new", "generate" and "" are allowed to generate a new random UUID\&.
.sp
Format: a valid RFC4122 universally unique identifier (UUID)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.wait\-activation\-delay\fR
.RS 4
Time in milliseconds to wait for connection to be considered activated\&. The wait will start after the pre\-up dispatcher event\&.

The value 0 means no wait time\&. The default value is \-1, which currently has the same meaning as no wait time\&.
.sp
Format: int32
.RE
.PP
\fBconnection\&.wait\-device\-timeout\fR
.RS 4
Timeout in milliseconds to wait for device at startup\&. During boot, devices may take a while to be detected by the driver\&. This property will cause to delay NetworkManager\-wait\-online\&.service and nm\-online to give the device a chance to appear\&. This works by waiting for the given timeout until a compatible device for the profile is available and managed\&.

.sp
Certificate data is specified using a "scheme"; three are currently supported: blob, path and pkcs#11 URL\&. When using the blob scheme this property should be set to the certificate\*(Aqs DER encoded data\&. When using the path scheme, this property should be set to the full UTF\-8 encoded path of the certificate, prefixed with the string "file://" and ending with a terminating NUL byte\&. This property can be unset even if the EAP method supports CA certificates, but this allows man\-in\-the\-middle attacks and is NOT recommended\&.

A string sent to the DHCP server to identify the local machine which the DHCP server may use to customize the DHCP lease and options\&. When the property is a hex string (\*(Aqaa:bb:cc\*(Aq) it is interpreted as a binary client ID, in which case the first byte is assumed to be the \*(Aqtype\*(Aq field as per RFC 2132 section 9\&.14 and the remaining bytes may be an hardware address (e\&.g\&. \*(Aq01:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx\*(Aq where 1 is the Ethernet ARP type and the rest is a MAC address)\&. If the property is not a hex string it is considered as a non\-hardware\-address client ID and the \*(Aqtype\*(Aq field is set to 0\&.
.sp
The special values "mac" and "perm\-mac" are supported, which use the current or permanent MAC address of the device to generate a client identifier with type ethernet (01)\&. Currently, these options only work for ethernet type of links\&.
.sp
The special value "ipv6\-duid" uses the DUID from "ipv6\&.dhcp\-duid" property as an RFC4361\-compliant client identifier\&. As IAID it uses "ipv4\&.dhcp\-iaid" and falls back to "ipv6\&.dhcp\-iaid" if unset\&.
.sp
The special value "duid" generates a RFC4361\-compliant client identifier based on "ipv4\&.dhcp\-iaid" and uses a DUID generated by hashing /etc/machine\-id\&.
.sp
The special value "stable" is supported to generate a type 0 client identifier based on the stable\-id (see connection\&.stable\-id) and a per\-host key\&. If you set the stable\-id, you may want to include the "${DEVICE}" or "${MAC}" specifier to get a per\-device key\&.

Flags for the DHCP hostname and FQDN\&.

Currently, this property only includes flags to control the FQDN flags set in the DHCP FQDN option\&. Supported FQDN flags are NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_SERV_UPDATE (0x1), NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_ENCODED (0x2) and NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_NO_UPDATE (0x4)\&. When no FQDN flag is set and NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS (0x8) is set, the DHCP FQDN option will contain no flag\&. Otherwise, if no FQDN flag is set and NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_CLEAR_FLAGS (0x8) is not set, the standard FQDN flags are set in the request: NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_SERV_UPDATE (0x1), NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_ENCODED (0x2) for IPv4 and NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_FQDN_SERV_UPDATE (0x1) for IPv6\&.
.sp
When this property is set to the default value NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_NONE (0x0), a global default is looked up in NetworkManager configuration\&. If that value is unset or also NM_DHCP_HOSTNAME_FLAG_NONE (0x0), then the standard FQDN flags described above are sent in the DHCP requests\&.

A string containing the "Identity Association Identifier" (IAID) used by the DHCP client\&. The string can be a 32\-bit number (either decimal, hexadecimal or as colon separated hexadecimal numbers)\&. Alternatively it can be set to the special values "mac", "perm\-mac", "ifname" or "stable"\&. When set to "mac" (or "perm\-mac"), the last 4 bytes of the current (or permanent) MAC address are used as IAID\&. When set to "ifname", the IAID is computed by hashing the interface name\&. The special value "stable" can be used to generate an IAID based on the stable\-id (see connection\&.stable\-id), a per\-host key and the interface name\&. When the property is unset, the value from global configuration is used; if no global default is set then the IAID is assumed to be "ifname"\&.
.sp
For DHCPv4, the IAID is only used with "ipv4\&.dhcp\-client\-id" values "duid" and "ipv6\-duid" to generate the client\-id\&.
.sp
For DHCPv6, note that at the moment this property is only supported by the "internal" DHCPv6 plugin\&. The "dhclient" DHCPv6 plugin always derives the IAID from the MAC address\&.

DNS servers priority\&.
.sp
The relative priority for DNS servers specified by this setting\&. A lower numerical value is better (higher priority)\&.
.sp
Negative values have the special effect of excluding other configurations with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence of at least one negative priority, only DNS servers from connections with the lowest priority value will be used\&. To avoid all DNS leaks, set the priority of the profile that should be used to the most negative value of all active connections profiles\&.
.sp
Zero selects a globally configured default value\&. If the latter is missing or zero too, it defaults to 50 for VPNs (including WireGuard) and 100 for other connections\&.
.sp
Note that the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active connections\&. It does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the same connection profile\&.
.sp
When multiple devices have configurations with the same priority, VPNs will be considered first, then devices with the best (lowest metric) default route and then all other devices\&.
.sp
When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top of resolv\&.conf\&. To prioritize a given server over another one within the same connection, just specify them in the desired order\&. Note that commonly the resolver tries name servers in /etc/resolv\&.conf in the order listed, proceeding with the next server in the list on failure\&. See for example the "rotate" option of the dns\-options setting\&. If there are any negative DNS priorities, then only name servers from the devices with that lowest priority will be considered\&.
.sp
When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or Split DNS (with dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd\-resolved settings), each connection is used to query domains in its search list\&. The search domains determine which name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is used to prioritize name servers based on the domain\&. Queries for domains not present in any search list are routed through connections having the \*(Aq~\&.\*(Aq special wildcard domain, which is added automatically to connections with the default route (or can be added manually)\&. When multiple connections specify the same domain, the one with the best priority (lowest numerical value) wins\&. If a sub domain is configured on another interface it will be accepted regardless the priority, unless parent domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes the sub domain to be shadowed\&. With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS leaks by properly configuring DNS priorities and the search domains, so that only name servers of the desired interface are configured\&.

\fBipv6\&.dns\-priority\fR

DNS servers priority\&.
.sp
The relative priority for DNS servers specified by this setting\&. A lower numerical value is better (higher priority)\&.
.sp
Negative values have the special effect of excluding other configurations with a greater numerical priority value; so in presence of at least one negative priority, only DNS servers from connections with the lowest priority value will be used\&. To avoid all DNS leaks, set the priority of the profile that should be used to the most negative value of all active connections profiles\&.
.sp
Zero selects a globally configured default value\&. If the latter is missing or zero too, it defaults to 50 for VPNs (including WireGuard) and 100 for other connections\&.
.sp
Note that the priority is to order DNS settings for multiple active connections\&. It does not disambiguate multiple DNS servers within the same connection profile\&.
.sp
When multiple devices have configurations with the same priority, VPNs will be considered first, then devices with the best (lowest metric) default route and then all other devices\&.
.sp
When using dns=default, servers with higher priority will be on top of resolv\&.conf\&. To prioritize a given server over another one within the same connection, just specify them in the desired order\&. Note that commonly the resolver tries name servers in /etc/resolv\&.conf in the order listed, proceeding with the next server in the list on failure\&. See for example the "rotate" option of the dns\-options setting\&. If there are any negative DNS priorities, then only name servers from the devices with that lowest priority will be considered\&.
.sp
When using a DNS resolver that supports Conditional Forwarding or Split DNS (with dns=dnsmasq or dns=systemd\-resolved settings), each connection is used to query domains in its search list\&. The search domains determine which name servers to ask, and the DNS priority is used to prioritize name servers based on the domain\&. Queries for domains not present in any search list are routed through connections having the \*(Aq~\&.\*(Aq special wildcard domain, which is added automatically to connections with the default route (or can be added manually)\&. When multiple connections specify the same domain, the one with the best priority (lowest numerical value) wins\&. If a sub domain is configured on another interface it will be accepted regardless the priority, unless parent domain on the other interface has a negative priority, which causes the sub domain to be shadowed\&. With Split DNS one can avoid undesired DNS leaks by properly configuring DNS priorities and the search domains, so that only name servers of the desired interface are configured\&.

An element can be prefixed with a pipe symbol (|) or an ampersand (&)\&. The former means that the element is optional and the latter means that it is mandatory\&. If there are any optional elements, than the match evaluates to true if at least one of the optional element matches (logical OR)\&. If there are any mandatory elements, then they all must match (logical AND)\&. By default, an element is optional\&. This means that an element "foo" behaves the same as "|foo"\&. An element can also be inverted with exclamation mark (!) between the pipe symbol (or the ampersand) and before the pattern\&. Note that "!foo" is a shortcut for the mandatory match "&!foo"\&. Finally, a backslash can be used at the beginning of the element (after the optional special characters) to escape the start of the pattern\&. For example, "&\e\e!a" is an mandatory match for literally "!a"\&.

.RS 4
With "cloned\-mac\-address" setting "random" or "stable", by default all bits of the MAC address are scrambled and a locally\-administered, unicast MAC address is created\&. This property allows to specify that certain bits are fixed\&. Note that the least significant bit of the first MAC address will always be unset to create a unicast MAC address\&.
.sp
If the property is NULL, it is eligible to be overwritten by a default connection setting\&. If the value is still NULL or an empty string, the default is to create a locally\-administered, unicast MAC address\&.
.sp
If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask\&. The set bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address of the device, while the unset bits are subject to randomization\&. Setting "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00" means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC address and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the "random" or "stable" algorithm\&.
.sp
If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask, this address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits that shall not be randomized\&. For example, a value of "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00 68:F7:28:00:00:00" will set the OUI of the MAC address to 68:F7:28, while the lower bits are randomized\&. A value of "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled globally\-administered, burned\-in MAC address\&.

If the value contains more than one additional MAC addresses, one of them is chosen randomly\&. For example, "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled MAC address, randomly locally or globally administered\&.

\fBwireguard\&.ip4\-auto\-default\-route\fR
.RS 4
Whether to enable special handling of the IPv4 default route\&. If enabled, the IPv4 default route from wireguard\&.peer\-routes will be placed to a dedicated routing\-table and two policy routing rules will be added\&. The fwmark number is also used as routing\-table for the default\-route, and if fwmark is zero, an unused fwmark/table is chosen automatically\&. This corresponds to what wg\-quick does with Table=auto and what WireGuard calls "Improved Rule\-based Routing"\&.
.sp
Note that for this automatism to work, you usually don\*(Aqt want to set ipv4\&.gateway, because that will result in a conflicting default route\&.
.sp
Leaving this at the default will enable this option automatically if ipv4\&.never\-default is not set and there are any peers that use a default\-route as allowed\-ips\&. Since this automatism only makes sense if you also have a peer with an /0 allowed\-ips, it is usually not necessary to enable this explicitly\&.

Configures AP isolation, which prevents communication between wireless devices connected to this AP\&. This property can be set to a value different from NM_TERNARY_DEFAULT (\-1) only when the interface is configured in AP mode\&.
.sp
If set to NM_TERNARY_TRUE (1), devices are not able to communicate with each other\&. This increases security because it protects devices against attacks from other clients in the network\&.

.RS 4
Alias: cloned\-mac
.sp
If specified, request that the device use this MAC address instead\&. This is known as MAC cloning or spoofing\&.
.sp
Beside explicitly specifying a MAC address, the special values "preserve", "permanent", "random" and "stable" are supported\&. "preserve" means not to touch the MAC address on activation\&. "permanent" means to use the permanent hardware address of the device\&. "random" creates a random MAC address on each connect\&. "stable" creates a hashed MAC address based on connection\&.stable\-id and a machine dependent key\&.
.sp
If unspecified, the value can be overwritten via global defaults, see manual of NetworkManager\&.conf\&. If still unspecified, it defaults to "preserve" (older versions of NetworkManager may use a different default value)\&.

\fB802\-11\-wireless\&.generate\-mac\-address\-mask\fR
.RS 4
With "cloned\-mac\-address" setting "random" or "stable", by default all bits of the MAC address are scrambled and a locally\-administered, unicast MAC address is created\&. This property allows to specify that certain bits are fixed\&. Note that the least significant bit of the first MAC address will always be unset to create a unicast MAC address\&.
.sp
If the property is NULL, it is eligible to be overwritten by a default connection setting\&. If the value is still NULL or an empty string, the default is to create a locally\-administered, unicast MAC address\&.
.sp
If the value contains one MAC address, this address is used as mask\&. The set bits of the mask are to be filled with the current MAC address of the device, while the unset bits are subject to randomization\&. Setting "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00" means to preserve the OUI of the current MAC address and only randomize the lower 3 bytes using the "random" or "stable" algorithm\&.
.sp
If the value contains one additional MAC address after the mask, this address is used instead of the current MAC address to fill the bits that shall not be randomized\&. For example, a value of "FE:FF:FF:00:00:00 68:F7:28:00:00:00" will set the OUI of the MAC address to 68:F7:28, while the lower bits are randomized\&. A value of "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled globally\-administered, burned\-in MAC address\&.
.sp
If the value contains more than one additional MAC addresses, one of them is chosen randomly\&. For example, "02:00:00:00:00:00 00:00:00:00:00:00 02:00:00:00:00:00" will create a fully scrambled MAC address, randomly locally or globally administered\&.

In infrastructure mode, various workarounds are used for a more reliable discovery of hidden networks, such as probe\-scanning the SSID\&. However, these workarounds expose inherent insecurities with hidden SSID networks, and thus hidden SSID networks should be used with caution\&.
.sp
In AP mode, the created network does not broadcast its SSID\&.
