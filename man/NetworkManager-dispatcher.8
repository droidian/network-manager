NetworkManager-dispatcher \- Dispatch user scripts for NetworkManager
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBNetworkManager\ \fR\fB[OPTIONS...]\fR\ 'u
\fBNetworkManager \fR\fB[OPTIONS...]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
NetworkManager\-dispatcher service is a D\-Bus activated service that runs user provided scripts upon certain changes in NetworkManager\&.
.PP
NetworkManager\-dispatcher will execute scripts in the
/{etc,usr/lib}/NetworkManager/dispatcher\&.d
directory or subdirectories in alphabetical order in response to network events\&. Each script should be a regular executable file owned by root\&. Furthermore, it must not be writable by group or other, and not setuid\&.
.PP
Each script receives two arguments, the first being the interface name of the device an operation just happened on, and second the action\&. For device actions, the interface is the name of the kernel interface suitable for IP configuration\&. Thus it is either VPN_IP_IFACE, DEVICE_IP_IFACE, or DEVICE_IFACE, as applicable\&. For the
\fIhostname\fR
action the device name is always
"none"\&. For
\fIconnectivity\-change\fR
and
\fIdns\-change\fR
it is empty\&.
.PP
The actions are:
.PP
\fIpre\-up\fR
.RS 4
The interface is connected to the network but is not yet fully activated\&. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or symlinked into the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher\&.d/pre\-up\&.d
directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before indicating to applications that the interface is fully activated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIup\fR
.RS 4
The interface has been activated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIpre\-down\fR
.RS 4
The interface will be deactivated but has not yet been disconnected from the network\&. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or symlinked into the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher\&.d/pre\-down\&.d
directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before disconnecting the interface from its network\&. Note that this event is not emitted for forced disconnections, like when carrier is lost or a wireless signal fades\&. It is only emitted when there is an opportunity to cleanly handle a network disconnection event\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdown\fR
.RS 4
The interface has been deactivated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIvpn\-pre\-up\fR
.RS 4
The VPN is connected to the network but is not yet fully activated\&. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or symlinked into the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher\&.d/pre\-up\&.d
directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before indicating to applications that the VPN is fully activated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIvpn\-up\fR
.RS 4
A VPN connection has been activated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIvpn\-pre\-down\fR
.RS 4
The VPN will be deactivated but has not yet been disconnected from the network\&. Scripts acting on this event must be placed or symlinked into the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher\&.d/pre\-down\&.d
directory, and NetworkManager will wait for script execution to complete before disconnecting the VPN from its network\&. Note that this event is not emitted for forced disconnections, like when the VPN terminates unexpectedly or general connectivity is lost\&. It is only emitted when there is an opportunity to cleanly handle a VPN disconnection event\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIvpn\-down\fR
.RS 4
A VPN connection has been deactivated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIhostname\fR
.RS 4
The system hostname has been updated\&. Use gethostname(2) to retrieve it\&. The interface name (first argument) is empty and no environment variable is set for this action\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdhcp4\-change\fR
.RS 4
The DHCPv4 lease has changed (renewed, rebound, etc)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdhcp6\-change\fR
.RS 4
The DHCPv6 lease has changed (renewed, rebound, etc)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIconnectivity\-change\fR
.RS 4
The network connectivity state has changed (no connectivity, went online, etc)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIreapply\fR
.RS 4
The connection was reapplied on the device\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdns\-change\fR
.RS 4
The DNS configuration has changed\&. This action is raised even if NetworkManager is configured to not manage resolv\&.conf (for example, via dns=none)\&. In such case, the dispatch script can discover the DNS configuration provided by currently active connections by looking at file
/run/NetworkManager/resolv\&.conf
.RE
.PP
\fIdevice\-add\fR
.RS 4
This action is called when a connection of type
generic
has the
generic\&.device\-handler
property set\&. The property indicates the name of a dispatcher script to be executed in directory
/{etc,usr/lib}/NetworkManager/dispatcher\&.d/device\&. Note that differently from other actions, only one script is executed\&.
.sp
The script needs to perform any action needed to create the device for the generic connection\&. On successful termination, the script returns zero\&. Otherwise, it returns a non\-zero value to indicate an error\&. The script can return values to NetworkManager by writing to standard output; each line should contain a key name followed by the equal sign \*(Aq=\*(Aq and a key value\&. The keys understood at the moment are:
.PP
\fIIFINDEX\fR
.RS 4
Indicates the interface index of the interface created by the script\&. This key is required when the script succeeds; if it is not set, the activation will fail\&. The key is ignored in case of script failure\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIERROR\fR
.RS 4
Specifies an error message indicating the cause of the script failure\&. It is ignored when the script succeeds\&.
.RE
.sp
Since the dispatcher service captures stdout for parsing those keys, anything written to stdout will not appear in the dispatcher service journal log\&. Use stderr if you want to print messages to the journal (for example, for debugging)\&. Only the first 8KiB of stdout are considered and among those, only the first 64 lines; the rest is ignored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIdevice\-delete\fR
.RS 4
This action is the counterpart of
device\-add
and is called to delete the device for a generic connection\&. All the aspects described for
device\-add
also apply to this action, with the only exception that key
\fIIFINDEX\fR
is ignored\&. It is not necessary to delete the kernel link in the handler because NetworkManager already does that; therefore the action is useful for any additional cleanup needed\&.
.RE
.PP
The environment contains more information about the interface and the connection\&. The following variables are available for the use in the dispatcher scripts:
.PP
\fINM_DISPATCHER_ACTION\fR
.RS 4
The dispatcher action like "up" or "dhcp4\-change", identical to the first command line argument\&. Since NetworkManager 1\&.12\&.0\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICONNECTION_UUID\fR
.RS 4
The UUID of the connection profile\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICONNECTION_ID\fR
.RS 4
The name (ID) of the connection profile\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICONNECTION_DBUS_PATH\fR
.RS 4
The NetworkManager D\-Bus path of the connection\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICONNECTION_FILENAME\fR
.RS 4
The backing file name of the connection profile (if any)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICONNECTION_EXTERNAL\fR
.RS 4
If "1", this indicates that the connection describes a network configuration created outside of NetworkManager\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDEVICE_IFACE\fR
.RS 4
The interface name of the control interface of the device\&. Depending on the device type, this differs from
\fIDEVICE_IP_IFACE\fR\&. For example for ADSL devices, this could be \*(Aqatm0\*(Aq or for WWAN devices it might be \*(AqttyUSB0\*(Aq\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDEVICE_IP_IFACE\fR
.RS 4
The IP interface name of the device\&. This is the network interface on which IP addresses and routes will be configured\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIP4_ADDRESS_N\fR
.RS 4
The IPv4 address in the format "address/prefix gateway", where N is a number from 0 to (# IPv4 addresses \- 1)\&. gateway item in this variable is deprecated, use IP4_GATEWAY instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIP4_NUM_ADDRESSES\fR
.RS 4
The variable contains the number of IPv4 addresses the script may expect\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIP4_GATEWAY\fR
.RS 4
The gateway IPv4 address in traditional numbers\-and\-dots notation\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIP4_ROUTE_N\fR
.RS 4
The IPv4 route in the format "address/prefix next\-hop metric", where N is a number from 0 to (# IPv4 routes \- 1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIP4_NUM_ROUTES\fR
.RS 4
The variable contains the number of IPv4 routes the script may expect\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIP4_NAMESERVERS\fR
.RS 4
The variable contains a space\-separated list of the DNS servers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIP4_DOMAINS\fR
.RS 4
The variable contains a space\-separated list of the search domains\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIDHCP4_<dhcp\-option\-name>\fR
.RS 4
If the connection used DHCP for address configuration, the received DHCP configuration is passed in the environment using standard DHCP option names, prefixed with "DHCP4_", like "DHCP4_HOST_NAME=foobar"\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIIP6_<name> and DHCP6_<name>\fR
.RS 4
The same variables as for IPv4 are available for IPv6, but the prefixes are IP6_ and DHCP6_ instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICONNECTIVITY_STATE\fR
.RS 4
The network connectivity state, which can take the values defined by the NMConnectivityState type, from the org\&.freedesktop\&.NetworkManager D\-Bus API:
UNKNOWN,
NONE,
PORTAL,
LIMITED
or
FULL\&. Note: this variable will only be set for connectivity\-change actions\&.
.RE
.PP
In case of VPN, VPN_IP_IFACE is set, and IP4_*, IP6_* variables with VPN prefix are exported too, like VPN_IP4_ADDRESS_0, VPN_IP4_NUM_ADDRESSES\&.
.PP
The content of the
user
setting for the connection being activated is also passed via environment variables\&. Each key is stored in a variable with name
CONNECTION_USER_
concatenated with the encoding of the key name\&. The encoding works as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
lowercase letters become uppercase
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
uppercase letters are prefixed with an underscore
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
numbers do not change
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
a dot is replaced with a double underscore
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
any other character is encoded with an underscore followed by its 3\-digit octal representation
.RE
.sp
For example, key
test\&.foo\-Bar2
is stored in a variable named
CONNECTION_USER_TEST__FOO_055_BAR2\&.
.PP
Dispatcher scripts are run one at a time, but asynchronously from the main NetworkManager process, and will be killed if they run for too long\&. If your script might take arbitrarily long to complete, you should spawn a child process and have the parent return immediately\&. Scripts that are symbolic links pointing inside the
/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher\&.d/no\-wait\&.d/
directory are run immediately, without waiting for the termination of previous scripts, and in parallel\&. Also beware that once a script is queued, it will always be run, even if a later event renders it obsolete\&. (Eg, if an interface goes up, and then back down again quickly, it is possible that one or more "up" scripts will be run after the interface has gone down\&.)
