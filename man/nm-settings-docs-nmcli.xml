<varlistentry>
<term><varname>burst U32</varname></term>
<listitem>
<para>
Also known as buffer or maxburst.  Size of the bucket, in
bytes. This is the maximum amount of bytes that tokens can
be available for instantaneously.  In general, larger
shaping rates require a larger buffer. For 10mbit/s on
Intel, you need at least 10kbyte buffer if you want to
reach your configured rate!
</para>
<para>
If your buffer is too small, packets may be dropped
because more tokens arrive per timer tick than fit in your
bucket.  The minimum buffer size can be calculated by
dividing the rate by HZ.
</para>
<para>
Token usage calculations are performed using a table which
by default has a resolution of 8 packets.  This resolution
can be changed by specifying the cell size with the burst.
For example, to specify a 6000 byte buffer with a 16 byte
cell size, set a burst of 6000/16. You will probably never
have to set this. Must be an integral power of 2.
