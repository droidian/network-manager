network-manager (1.44.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  NetworkManager or rather NetworkManager-dispatcher will no longer execute
  ifupdown hook scripts from /etc/network/if-*.d/ on network state changes.

  Packages that want to be notified and react on such network state changes
  are advised to ship native NetworkManager scripts in
  /usr/lib/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d.

  Users may provide local hook scripts or override package provided ones by
  installing those into /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d.

  For further information about the NetworkManager-dispatcher interface see
  the NetworkManager-dispatcher(8) man page.
