network-manager (0.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * More integration work. (Closes: #355244)
    - Added network-manager-dispatcher.script and
      06-dispatch_more_events.patch.
      This way the scripts in /etc/networks/if-*.d/ are called properly by
      NetworkManagerDispatcher.
      Thanks to the Ubuntu devs for this work!
    - Added 08-disabled_devices.patch. Network interfaces listed in
      /etc/network/interfaces which are not configured "auto" and "dhcp" are
      not handled by NM. This makes it possible to configure interfaces 
      statically and have NM not messing with them. 
      Updated README.Debian to reflect these changes.
    - Added 09-nm_bad_mutex_free.patch. Otherwise NM crashes if a device is
      disabled.
  * Added 07-libnm_glib_reconnect_dbus.patch which makes libnm_glib sleep 
    between unsuccessful connection attempts to dbus. (Closes: #366010)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.7.2, no further changes required.
  * Removed *.la files from the dev packages as we also ship pkg-config files
    which are a better alternative.
  * Added 10-interface_parser_fixes.patch which fixes several problems with
    the /etc/network/interfaces parser. (Closes: #355564)

    debian/rules accordingly.
  * Added dependency on hal (Closes: #356622)

    started automatically on login.
