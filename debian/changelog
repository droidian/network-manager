    - debian/patches/11-man_page_sh_name.patch

    package.

      + Update Build-Depends. Add autotools-dev, libglib2.0-dev and iproute, 
        remove libpanel-applet2-dev.
    - debian/rules
      + Do not build the nm-applet.1 manpage anymore.
      + Exclude nm-vpn-properties from dh_shlibdeps. This is a temporary
        workaround until this binary has also been moved into the nm-applet
        source package.
    - debian/copyright

network-manager (0.6.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * More integration work. (Closes: #355244)
    - Added network-manager-dispatcher.script and
      06-dispatch_more_events.patch.
      This way the scripts in /etc/networks/if-*.d/ are called properly by
      NetworkManagerDispatcher.
      Thanks to the Ubuntu devs for this work!
    - Added 08-disabled_devices.patch. Network interfaces listed in
      /etc/network/interfaces which are not configured "auto" and "dhcp" are
      not handled by NM. This makes it possible to configure interfaces 
      statically and have NM not messing with them. 
      Updated README.Debian to reflect these changes.
    - Added 09-nm_bad_mutex_free.patch. Otherwise NM crashes if a device is
      disabled.

    between unsuccessful connection attempts to dbus. (Closes: #366010)

  * Removed *.la files from the dev packages as we also ship pkg-config files
    which are a better alternative.

    the /etc/network/interfaces parser. (Closes: #355564)

    debian/rules accordingly.
  * Added dependency on hal (Closes: #356622)
