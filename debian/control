Description: network management framework daemon
 NetworkManager attempts to keep an active network connection available at all
 times. It is intended only for the desktop use-case, and is not intended for
 usage on servers. The point of NetworkManager is to make networking
 configuration and setup as painless and automatic as possible.  If using DHCP,
 NetworkManager is _intended_ to replace default routes, obtain IP addresses
 from a DHCP server, and change nameservers whenever it sees fit.
