NetworkManger consists of two parts: one is on the system level daemon that
manages the connections and gathers information about new networks. The other 
is an applet that users can use to interact with the NetworkManager daemon. 

To allow users to connect to the NetworkManager daemon they have to be in the
group "netdev". If you want to add a user to group "netdev" use the command
"adduser username netdev" or one of the graphical user management frontends.
After that you have to reload dbus with the command "/etc/init.d/dbus reload".
